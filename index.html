			<h3>About Me</h3>
			<h4>BACKGROUND</h4>
			
			<p class="desc"> <img src="Cat.jpg" style="height: 300px; width: 180px; margin:10px 10px 10px 10px; clear: left; float: left;"/>
			I am a 3rd year student at Meredith College in Raleigh NC, graduating in May 2019. Over the past summer I conducted research 
			in cyber-security and neural networks, which you can read about <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3140655" 
			style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(242,75,114) ;" target="_blank">here</a>. I will also be completing an internship this
			summer 2018 with UnitedHealth Group's technology offices, Optum. 
			
			</br></br>I'm a <strong style="color:rgb(180,230,200);">Computer Science</strong> major	and a double 
			minor in <strong style="color:  rgb(180,230,200);">Mathematics</strong> and <strong style="color:  rgb(180,230,200);">Graphic Design
			</strong>, evidence of my both analytically-driven and creative background. I have constantly juggled between these two sides of
			my personality, and I have finally found the best of both worlds: <strong style="color:  rgb(180,230,200);">UX Design</strong>.</p>

			<h3>Background</h3>
			<p class="desc">I am ambitious and have history of leadership skills as well as a strong ability to work in a team. I
			recently have completed summer undergraduate research at the University of North Texas in cyber-security, and I 
			hope to do more research at my home institution this upcoming year. Last year, I worked in my college's Technology
			Services department, where I was responsible for helping organize and plan events, garnering interest in students
			about the services offered, and assessing and solving technology-related issues students and faculty face. In addition
			to this, I have completed course training in information security for the position. 
			I am also active in on-campus organizations, and am currently serving as 2019 Class Senator and as President
			for the Math/CS club, as well as a member of Artist’s Alliance, Black Student Union, and Alpha Lambda Delta Honors Society.
			Through my Senate position, I have exhibited detail-oriented ability in my deliberate way of reviewing of organizational
			constitutions. Having served as the Publicity Chair for the Math/CS, I have been able to boost interest in Computer Science
			by being creative in my methods of outreach, and was voted to be President this past semester. <br/>
			Along with my involvement in on-campus organizations, I also try to supplement my education by attending conferences and
			participating in competitions. Towards the end of my freshman and sophomore years, I entered and won a college-wide 
			Mathematics competition, and was awarded with scholarship.</br>
			My coursework includes Calculus III, Statistics, Discrete Mathematics, and Linear Algebra. In computer science, I have Java,
			Python, C++, Matlab, Javascript, and HTML/ CSS experience language-wise. I also will have more experience with data structures
			and algorithms, graphics, and overall web design by the end of the fall semester due to my current coursework. Through 
			a program called PAGE SSP, I helped lead a mini-course for academically-gifted young students about coding during the spring
			of my freshman year. This experience showed me that I have a passion for improving the human side of technology and that 
			I want to be more involved with creating more accessible visual representations of technology.</br>
			After earning my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, I plan to do graduate research in either Human-Computer Interactions
			or Artificial Intelligence. I plan to simultaneously work for a gaming or simulations company to not only deepen my knowledge
			about human-computer interactions but to also build my creative side. Once I graduate, I plan to continue conducting research
			and will continue to design programs to be used for training, educational, or rehabilitation purposes. For undergraduate research,
			I am mostly interested in virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and graphics because Virtual Reality and Artificial Intelligence
			are to me the most viable options for optimizing Human-Computer Interactions. </p>

			<h3>Current Work</h3>
			<p class="desc">Our research combines the disciplines of cyber-security, machine learning, and cryptography. Working with a
			graduate student, I am responsible for encrypting plaintext datasets for our deep neural network to be implemented
			over using a homomorphic encryption library, HElib. Our goal is to see the networks' ability to be implemented over
			training datasets that it doesn't have direct access to, and to compare the networks' effectiveness to a network trained 
			with data it has direct access to. We believe that if a network can be trained using encrypted data, we can improve the 
			level of security and privacy users would have over their own data from machine learning algorithms, such as Google's
			search engine.
